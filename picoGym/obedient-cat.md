## Challenge Description
This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear"). [Download flag](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/fb851c1858cc762bd4eed569013d7f00/flag).

## Solution Steps
Usually the first/early challenges are meant to make sure that you can successfully submit a flag. This one just has a file download.

There’s no file extension, which isn’t a problem in linux, but can be problematic on Windows. I opened it with Notepad since it said the flag was “in plain sight”. If in linux, the “cat” command (hence the title) should be able to display the contents of the file.
