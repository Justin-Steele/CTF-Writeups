## Challenge Description
If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

## Solution Steps
0x70 is a hex representation of the decimal number 112. ((16*7) + (1*0))
I looked up an ASCII table [here](https://www.asciitable.com/). This also had the hex value, so the previous step was unnecessary. Looking at the table, the character for 0x70 is 'p'.
